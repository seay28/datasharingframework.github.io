::: tip Work in progress
We are currently in the process of updating the written documentation on how to create a DSF process plugin. In the meantime we recommend to study the oldstable version of the [process plugin tutorial](/oldstable/guideline/tutorial/). Additionally, we recommend to take a look at the upgraded DSF processes here:
- The [hello world plugin](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf-process-hello-world/tree/develop)
- The [ping pong plugin](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf-process-ping-pong)
- The [update allowlist plugin](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf-process-allow-list)
