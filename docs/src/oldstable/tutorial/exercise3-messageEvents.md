# Exercise 3 - Message Events
Communication between organizations is modeled using message flow in BPMN processes. The third exercise shows how a process at one organization can trigger a process at another organization.

To demonstrate communication between two organizations we will configure message flow between the processes ``highmedorg_helloDic`` and ``highmedorg_helloCos``. The processes are then to be executed at the organizations ``Test_DIC`` and ``Test_COS`` respectively in the docker test setup, with the former triggering execution of the latter by automatically sending a [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) from organization ``Test_DIC`` to organization ``Test_COS``.

#### Introduction
---
#### Message Flow and FHIR Task resources

BPMN processes are instantiated and started within the DSF by creating a matching FHIR [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) resource in the DSF FHIR server. This is true for executing a process on the local DSF BPE server by manually creating a [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) resource, but also works by creating and starting a process instance at a remote DSF BPE server from an executing process automatically.

In order to exchange information between different processes, for example at two different organizations, BPMN message flow is used. Typically represented by a dashed line arrow between elements with black (send) and white (receive) envelop icons. The following BPMN collaboration diagram shows two processes. The process at "Organization 1" is sending a message to "Organization 2" which results in the instantiation and execution of new process instance at the second organization.

![Message Flow](/photos/guideline/tutorial/ex3.png)

Every time message flow is used in a BPMN process for the DSF, a corresponding FHIR [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) profile needs to be specified for every interaction. This profile specifies which process should be started or continued and what the message name is when correlating the appropriate [Message Start Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events/#message-start-event) or [Intermediate Message Catch Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events/#message-intermediate-catching-event). A *Business Key* and a *Correlation Key* are specified if different process instances need to be linked to a single execution, for example to be able to send a message back.

#### BPMN Process Definition Key vs. FHIR Task.instantiatesUri and ActivityDefinition.url / version

FHIR ActivityDefinition resources are used to announce what processes can be instantiated at a given DSF instance. They also control what kind of organization can request the instantiation or continuation of a process instance and what kind of organization is allowed to fulfill the request.

In order to link the FHIR and BPMN worlds the BPMN process definition key needs to be specified following the pattern ``^[-a-zA-Z0-9]+_[-a-zA-Z0-9]+$`` for example:
```
domainorg_processKey
```
In addition the BPM process needs to specify a process version with the pattern ``^\d+.\d+.\d+$`` for example:
```
1.0.0
```
This results in a canonical URL used to identify the process, for example:
```
http://domain.org/bpe/Process/processKey/1.0.0
```
The canonical URL is used for [Task.instantiatesUri](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) and [ActivityDefinition.url / version](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/activitydefinition.html).


#### ActivityDefinitions for the DSF

FHIR [ActivityDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/activitydefinition.html) resources are used to announce what processes can be instantiated at a given DSF instance and contain the authorization rules for the specified process. [ActivityDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/activitydefinition.html) for the DSF need to comply with the http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/activity-definition profile, with authorization rules configured using the http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-process-authorization extension.

The authorization extension needs to be configured at least once and has four sub extensions:

#### message-name [1..1]

String value specifying the message name of [Message Start Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events/#message-start-event), [Intermediate Message Catch Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events/#message-intermediate-catching-event) or [Message Receive Task](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/tasks/receive-task/) this authorization rule should match. Can only be specified once per authorization rule extension.

#### task-profile [1..1]

Canonical URL value specifying the [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) profile this authorization rule should match. Can only be specified once per authorization rule extension.

#### requester [1..]

Coding value matching entries from the http://highmed.org/fhir/ValueSet/process-authorization-requester ValueSet:

- LOCAL_ORGANIZATION A local organization with a specific identifier. The organization identifier needs to specified using the http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-process-authorization-organization extension.

- REMOTE_ORGANIZATION A remote (non local) organization with a specific identifier. The organization identifier needs to specified using the http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-process-authorization-organization extension.

- LOCAL_ROLE A local organizations with a specific role defined via [OrganizationAffiliation](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/organizationaffiliation.html). Role and consortium identifier need to be specified using the http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-process-authorization-consortium-role extension.

- REMOTE_ROLE A remote (non local) organizations with a specific role defined via [OrganizationAffiliation](hl7.org/fhir/R4/organizationaffiliation.html). Role and consortium identifier need to be specified using the http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-process-authorization-consortium-role extension.

- LOCAL_ALL All local organizations regardless of their identifier or role in a consortium.

- REMOTE_ALL All remote (non local) organizations regardless of their identifier or role in a consortium.

#### recipient [1..]

Coding value matching entries from the http://highmed.org/fhir/ValueSet/process-authorization-recipient ValueSet.

- LOCAL_ORGANIZATION Organization with a specific identifier. The organization identifier needs to specified using the http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-process-authorization-organization extension.

- LOCAL_ROLE Organizations with a specific role defined via [OrganizationAffiliation](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/organizationaffiliation.html). Role and consortium identifier need to be specified using the http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-process-authorization-consortium-role extension.

- LOCAL_ALL All organizations regardless of their identifier or role in a consortium.

The local organization of a DSF instance is configured using the environment variables [ORG_HIGHMED_DSF_FHIR_SERVER_ORGANIZATION_IDENTIFIER_VALUE](https://github.com/highmed/highmed-dsf/wiki/DSF-0.7.0-Configuration-Parameters-FHIR#org_highmed_dsf_fhir_server_organization_identifier_value) for the DSF FHIR server and [ORG_HIGHMED_DSF_BPE_FHIR_SERVER_ORGANIZATION_IDENTIFIER_VALUE](https://github.com/highmed/highmed-dsf/wiki/DSF-0.7.0-Configuration-Parameters-BPE#org_highmed_dsf_bpe_fhir_server_organization_identifier_value) for the DSF BPE server.

#### Authorization Extension Example

The following example specifies that process execution can only be requested by a organization with a specific identifier and only allows execution of the process in the DSF instance of an organization with a specific identifier.
```xml
<extension url="http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-process-authorization">
	<extension url="message-name">
		<valueString value="some-message-name" />
	</extension>
	<extension url="task-profile">
		<valueCanonical value="http://foo.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/profile|#{version}" />
	</extension>
	<extension url="requester">
		<valueCoding>
			<extension url="http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-process-authorization-organization">
				<valueIdentifier>
					<system value="http://highmed.org/sid/organization-identifier" />

	</extension>
</extension>
```

#### Exercise Tasks
---
1. Modify the ``highmedorg_helloDic`` process in the ``hello-dic.bpmn`` file and replace the [End Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/none-events/#none-end-event) with a [Message End Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events/#message-end-event). Configure input parameters ``instantiatesUri``, ``profile`` and ``messageName`` in the BPMN model for the [Message End Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events/#message-end-event). Set the message name of the [Message End Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events/#message-end-event) and configure it to be executed using the HelloCosMessage class.
    Use http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/task-hello-cos|#{version} as the profile and ``helloCos`` as the message name. Figure out what the appropriate ``instantiatesUri`` value is, based on the name (process definition key) of the process to be triggered.
2. Modify the ``highmedorg_helloCos`` process in the ``hello-cos.bpmn`` file and configure the message name of the [Message Start Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events/#message-start-event) with the same value as the message name of the [Message End Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.17/reference/bpmn20/events/message-events/#message-end-event) in the ``highmedorg_helloDic`` process.
3. Create a new [StructureDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition.html) with a [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) profile for the ``helloCos`` message.
4. Create a new [ActivityDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/activitydefinition.html) resource for the ``highmedorg_helloCos`` process and configure the authorization extension to allow the ``Test_DIC`` organization as the requester and the ``Test_COS`` organization as the recipient.
5. Add the ``highmedorg_helloCos`` process and its resources to the ``TutorialProcessPluginDefinition`` class.
6. Modify ``HelloDic`` service class to set the ``target`` process variable for the ``Test_COS`` organization.
7. Configure the ``HelloCosMessage`` class as a spring in the ``TutorialConfig`` class.


#### Solution Verification
---
#### Maven Build and Automated Tests

Execute a maven build of the ``dsf-process-tutorial`` parent module via:
```
mvn clean install -Pexercise-3
```
Verify that the build was successful and no test failures occurred.

#### Process Execution and Manual Tests

To verify the ``highmedorg_helloDic`` and ``highmedorg_helloCos`` processes can be executed successfully, we need to deploy them into DSF instances and execute the ``highmedorg_helloDic`` process. The maven ``install`` build is configured to create a process jar file with all necessary resources and copy the jar to the appropriate locations of the docker test setup.

1. Start the DSF FHIR server for the ``Test_DIC`` organization in a console at location ``.../dsf-process-tutorial/test-setup``:
```
docker-compose up dic-fhir
```
Verify the DSF FHIR server started successfully.

2. Start the DSF BPE server for the ``Test_DIC`` organization in another console at location ``.../dsf-process-tutorial/test-setup``:
```
docker-compose up dic-bpe
```
Verify the DSF BPE server started successfully and deployed the highmedorg_helloDic process.

3. Start the DSF FHIR server for the ``Test_COS`` organization in a console at location ``.../dsf-process-tutorial/test-setup``:
```
docker-compose up cos-fhir
```
Verify the DSF FHIR server started successfully. You can access the webservice of the DSF FHIR server at https://cos/fhir.
The DSF FHIR server uses a server certificate that was generated during the first maven build. To authenticate yourself to the server you can use the client certificate located at ``.../dsf-process-tutorial/test-data-generator/cert/Webbrowser_Test_User/Webbrowser_Test_User_certificate.p12`` (Password: password).

4. Start the DSF BPE server for the ``Test_COS`` organization in another console at location ``.../dsf-process-tutorial/test-setup``:
```
docker-compose up cos-bpe
```
Verify the DSF BPE server started successfully and deployed the ``highmedorg_helloCos`` process. The DSF BPE server should print a message that the process was deployed. The DSF FHIR server should now have a new [ActivityDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/activitydefinition.html) resource. Go to https://cos/fhir/ActivityDefinition to check if the expected resource was created by the BPE while deploying the process. The returned FHIR [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html) should contain two [ActivityDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/activitydefinition.html) resources. Also, go to https://cos/fhir/StructureDefinition?url=http://highmed.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/task-hello-cos to check if the expected [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) profile was created.

5. Start the ``highmedorg_helloDic`` process by posting a specific FHIR [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) resource to the DSF FHIR server of the ``Test_DIC`` organization: Execute therefore the ``main`` method of the ``org.highmed.dsf.process.tutorial.TutorialExampleStarter`` class to create the Task resource needed to start the ``highmedorg_helloDic`` process.

Verify that the FHIR [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) resource was created at the DSF FHIR server and the ``highmedorg_helloDic`` process was executed by the DSF BPE server of the ``Test_DIC`` organization. The DSF BPE server of the ``Test_DIC`` organization should print a message showing that a [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) resource to start the ``highmedorg_helloCos`` process was send to the ``Test_COS`` organization.
Verify that a FHIR [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html) resource was created at the DSF FHIR server of the ``Test_COS`` organization and the ``highmedorg_helloCos`` process was then executed by the DSF BPE server of the ``Test_COS`` organization.
