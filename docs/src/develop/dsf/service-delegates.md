### Service Delegates

Service Delegates are the Java representation of the [Service Tasks](../bpmn/service-tasks.md) in your BPMN model. You link a Service Delegate to a certain [Service Task](../bpmn/service-tasks.md) by selecting the [Service Task](../bpmn/service-tasks.md) in the [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) and adding a Java class to the `Implementation` field. Make sure you use the fully qualified class name. Like this:
```
org.package.myClass
```
All that is left is for your Java class to extend `AbstractServiceDelegate` and override the `doExecute` method. This is the place where you can put your actual business logic. The method will be called when the [BPMN process execution](bpmn-process-execution.md) arrives at the [Service Task](../bpmn/service-tasks.md) your Service Delegate is linked to. The constructor of your delegate class should also forward a `ProcessPluginApi` instance to its superclass constructor. You can learn more about the `ProcessPluginApi` [here](process-plugin-api.md).
