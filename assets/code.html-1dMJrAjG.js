This approach categorizes pull requests based on the level of trust and experience of the contributor, as well as the impact of the changes. Here&#39;s how we apply it:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Ship</strong>: For our most trusted contributors with a proven track record. These members can merge their pull requests without prior review, typically for minor or highly confident changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Show</strong>: This level is for trusted contributors who need some oversight, as well as for experienced developers who want to demonstrate how certain changes should be made in the future. They create pull requests and show their work to the team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask</strong>: New or less experienced contributors, as well as those submitting more complex changes, fall into this category. They are required to ask for feedback and approval before their changes can be merged, ensuring thorough review and quality control.</p></li></ol><p>This method helps us maintain a balance between code quality and efficient development, recognizing the varying levels of expertise among our contributors.</p><p>For more information on Fowler&#39;s approach, visit <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/ship-show-ask.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Fowler&#39;s article on Pull Requests</a>.</p><h2 id="data-security-in-dsf-development" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-security-in-dsf-development"><span>Data Security in DSF Development</span></a></h2><p>The DSF (Data Sharing Framework) and its process plugins are frequently used to transmit sensitive personal data.
