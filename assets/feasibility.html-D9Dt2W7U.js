To address this, Medical Data Integration Centers have been established, by the medical informatics initiative to consolidate data from primary information systems into a central repository. However, relying on data from only one organization is rarely sufficient to answer complex research questions, so merging data across institutional boundaries is necessary.</p><p>To enable researchers to leverage this integrated data for specific research projects, there is a critical need for the ability to query cohort sizes across institutions. The <a href="https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/feasibility-dsf-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feasibility</a> process allows researchers to conduct automated and distributed feasibility queries, i.e., cohort size estimates. This process is executed according to the open standard BPMN 2.0, the underlying process data model is based on HL7 FHIR R4 resources.</p><h2 id="technical-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-information"><span>Technical Information</span></a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/feasibility-deploy/wiki/DSF-Middleware-Setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DSF Middleware Setup</a>: The DSF middleware connects your site to the central platform.
